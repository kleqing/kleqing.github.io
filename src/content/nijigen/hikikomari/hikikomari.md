description: "In a world where death is not permanent, Terakomari \"Komari\" Gandesblood has been a self-proclaimed professional shut-in for the past three years. As part of the noble Gandesblood lineage, she once tried to meet the expectations of her family. However, as a vampire who cannot use magic or consume blood, she soon gave up on becoming an imperial general like her ancestors. Unfortunately, a misunderstanding with her father earns her the formidable position of one of the Seven Crimson Lords, the strongest fighters and generals in the Mulnite Empire."
