releaseYear: 2023
description: "Princess Anisphia \"Anis\" Wynn Palletia has always dreamed of flying through the sky, even though the people of her kingdom consider it a silly ambition. Also at odds with her goal is the fact that Anis is incapable of using magic despite her noble status. Refusing to give up so easily, she renounces her right to the throne, and focuses on developing \"magicology\" by combining various resources with knowledge from her previous life on Earth."
