yaagl (yet another anime game launcher) is an open-source project that aims to provide a seamless experience for running Hoyoverse's games, such as Genshin Impact and Honkai Impact 3rd, etc. on macOS.

I trust contributed as a translator for the Vietnamese language in this project.

Cation that use this launcher may violate the game's terms of service, so use it at your own risk.
