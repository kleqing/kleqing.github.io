> HoyoBar helps you track your Genshin Impact daily resin, expeditions, and more — straight in your macOS menu bar.

Paimon can help you —

* 🌙 Keep track of your daily resin.
* 💰 Monitor your daily expeditions and real-time realm currency.
* 🏁 Remind you about your daily commissions and weekly boss fights.
* 🍯 And notify you when your parametric transformer is ready to use.

Basically, `HoyoBar` lives in your macOS menu bar quietly, and offers you a nice way of monitoring your in-game real-time stats when you need to check them.
