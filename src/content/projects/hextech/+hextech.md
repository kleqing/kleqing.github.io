This is a shopping website for phones and tablets built with JavaEE (Jakarta EE) and MSSQL. It features user authentication, product browsing, a shopping cart, and order management functionalities.

This project was developed as part of a university course on web development using JavaEE technologies. It demonstrates the use of servlets, JSP, and JDBC for building dynamic web applications.

It's the first project and also is the last project that I used Java as the main programming language before moving to c# and JavaScript.
