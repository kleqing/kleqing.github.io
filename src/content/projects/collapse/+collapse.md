Collapse was originally designed for Honkai Impact 3rd. However, as the project evolved, this launcher is now a game client for all currently released miHoYo Games and even external games through its plugin system!

**Collapse** contains advanced features for **Honkai Impact 3rd** that not only provide you with the ability to download and launch the game, but also some additional features that the Official Launcher doesn't have, including:
* Caches Download (aka "Updating Settings" in-game).
* Game Data Repair (with less bandwidth required than the *Data Repair* feature in-game).
* Changing Game Settings (Graphics Settings & Audio Settings) without opening the game.
* Multi-Region Game Download Support (Allows for downloading and launching different versions of the game).
* Steam to Global version conversion (without re-downloading the whole game).
* Global to SEA version (or vice versa) conversion.
* Multi-session Download for faster Game Download/Installation.
* Multi-thread Game Extraction for faster installation.
* Delta-Patch Update Mechanism for smaller updates ([**Click here**](https://github.com/neon-nyan/CollapseLauncher/wiki/Update-Game-Region-with-Delta-Patch) for more info).
* Ability to select Graphics API (DirectX 11 (FL: 10.1, 11.0 and 11.1) and DirectX 12 [May crash the game in newer stages]).

Not only that, this launcher also has some advanced features for **Genshin Impact**, including but not limited to:
* Choosing your voice-line language during the first installation, so you don't have to download it inside the game.
* Repair the game files including Game Caches, Cutscenes, Audio Pack & persistent files outside of the game.
cluding Game Caches, Cutscenes, Audio Pack & persistent files outside of the game.


Collapse now supports the following games:
* Honkai Impact 3rd
* Genshin Impact
* Honkai: Star Rail
* Zenless Zone Zero
