This is a charity web platform with a sole purpose to leverage the process of doing charity and calling for help from others.
This web platform is suitable for:

- Users who are seeking for help from others
- Volunteers who want to participate in charity projects to do good deeds
- Group of friends or even organizations! who want to create and manage their own organization to carry out charity projects on the platform

This project is a part of my semester project during my study in university.

All project are built using ASP.NET Core MVC framework with C# as the backend language and Razor as the frontend templating engine.
