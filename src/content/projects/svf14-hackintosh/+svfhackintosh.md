This is a Hackintosh setup guide for Sony VAIO SVF14F series laptops, specifically the SVF14217SGW model. It includes instructions on how to install macOS on the laptop, as well as details on hardware compatibility and configuration.

Note that this method use opencore bootloader and is compatible with macOS Big Sur or lower. It may not work with other versions of macOS or other bootloaders.

Most DSDT/SSDT files used in this guide are sourced from the original laptop by itself, complied using MaciASL. Some patches are applied to fix specific hardware issues. (Battery due to EC differences)

The project already outdated cause the owner (me) sold the laptop, but the repository is still available for reference. 

If you have any questions or need help with the setup, or maybe you want to contribute to the project, feel free to open an issue or a pull request on the GitHub repository.
