The game was released on iOS and Android mobile platforms on 9 March 2017. A single-player version of the game was released for the Nintendo Switch on 18 May 2021.

The game serves as both a rhythm game with quite a bit of visual novel side gameplay, as it has a curated story novel with illustrations covering the two main female heroines, Tairitsu and Hikari. It’s also considered a three-dimensional music video game that allows unique and challenging gameplay. Another project revealed from Lowiro, titled In Falsus, is scheduled to be released in the first quarter of 2026.

### Gameplay

The main gameplay of Arcaea uses three-dimensional chart lanes that are split into two parts: The top lane and the bottom lane. The top lane consists of two different note types; Arcs in blue(L) or pink(R) that are color coded to indicate which hand to play with, that require the player to hold the note throughout its duration (arcs go in 360 degrees of direction, creating unique chart patterns), and sky notes that are single-tap notes that are present on the top lane. The bottom lane consists of two note types as well: Floor notes and long notes. Floor notes are basic single-tap notes that are present on the bottom lane (much like the sky notes), and long notes require the player to hold throughout their duration.

During the gameplay, players must keep track of two sets of notes moving across the screen, and tap the screen or press controller buttons when the notes intersect with the guiding lines. The game has 5 base difficulties: Past, Present, Future, Eternal, and Beyond (since version 5.7.0). It has a difficulty scale of 1-12, with + variants present, as low as the FTR difficulty (e.g., Future 9+), as a system better known for accurately capturing chart constants. The Arcaea chart constant is a detailed numerical value representing the difficulty/complexity of a song chart, providing a far more precise measure than the displayed difficulty level.

The game includes over 40+ characters referred to as partners that give various beneficial effects while playing the rhythm game, and they gain experience points when selected for gameplay to play in World Mode, a gameplay mode consisting of worlds that allows players to actively play songs to collect more songs, in-game currency, story progress, and possibly partners. This is where the Stamina features take in play, as different Worlds require different amounts of stamina taken every song played. The game starts with 12 bars of stamina by default, where it takes exactly thirty minutes to gain a bar. Worlds typically take either zero, two, and/or options for anything up to 6 bars of stamina.

The player's overall skill level (rank) on Arcaea is calculated by “Potential”. When a player starts with 0.00 PTT, the current highest potential that can be reached by any other player’s method is 13.27 PTT (if using the Tairitsu (Testify variant) partner). Potential is the result of mathematical calculations that revolve around a completed song of a chart’s main difficulty, letter grade, and high score. Sometimes, a player's potential can either drop, rise, or stay after completing a song based on one's performance. This potential system does not contribute to gameplay in similar ways, except for some songs that may only be unlocked to play once the player meets the requirement of a certain potential level, usually at 11.00 PTT for many boss songs.

Arcaea's main story is accessed through the “Story Mode” feature, where players progress through every separated little part of the chapters (also known as Story Packs) by playing the required songs under any difficulty.
