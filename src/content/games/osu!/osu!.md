The gameplay of osu! is based on the Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan series of rhythm games, which primarily involves clicking notes, which appear as circles, using a cursor or finger. Since the game's release, three other official "rulesets" (game modes) have been added, taking inspiration from various games. Unlike many rhythm games, levels in osu! are created and uploaded by users, increasing the range and volume of the song library, which is a factor contributing to the game's popularity.

The game has a significant connection to Japanese culture and anime music. It has also had effects on the Esports industry—professional gamers use osu! as an aim trainer to warm up and practice, and the community frequently organizes tournaments between players.

### Gameplay

Osu! is a rhythm game with multiple distinct game modes. If the player misses too many notes, they fail the song and must retry. In-game settings, called mods, can change gameplay in different ways—for example, by speeding up the song or increasing the size of circles. Songs are mapped to levels called beatmaps, and the same song can include multiple beatmaps of varying difficulties. Some beatmaps, including a tutorial, are bundled with a new installation of the game, but more can be downloaded from the game's website or directly from the game.

Beatmaps can be created and uploaded by all users. In the game's single-player mode, scores on beatmaps can be compared with other players, who are ranked on an online leaderboard. Scores are primarily measured using their performance points (abbreviated as PP), which account for various aspects of a player's skill. Users can add others as friends and chat in-game, and two multiplayer modes allowing groups of people to play beatmaps either synchronously or asynchronously with each other.

### Development

Osu! was created by Dean Herbert, an Australian developer known online as "peppy", as a computer version of Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan and Elite Beat Agents. One of his goals was to create longevity through enabling users to craft their own beatmaps. Herbert had experience creating video games prior to osu!, having made some during high school and university, but has said he did not think it would become his job. He began developing osu! while attending university and had a working build of the game after a few hours, which he shared with friends. It was written in C# using the XNA framework. The game's first public release was on 16 September 2007, and an open beta was officially available starting on 17 October. Due to the game's growth in popularity as well as user feedback, Herbert later added the extra game modes osu!mania, osu!taiko, and osu!catch, later renamed to rulesets. After releasing Osu!, Herbert, who had been working full-time for an IT company, gradually reduced his work hours to focus on maintaining osu!. According to Herbert, as of a July 2014 interview for the official osu! YouTube channel, the user interface of the game client and official website were undergoing full "revamps". In the same interview, he expressed interest or intentions to add major features to the game, such as a multiplayer power-up system inspired by Ouendan and TetriNET, 3D rotation of the field of play, and expanded multiplayer lobbies.

Osu! has three different builds; osu!stable, the original build, osu!lazer, which is a rewrite of the original game with new features and bugfixes, with the end goal being for osu!lazer to replace the stable build of osu!; and osu!stream, a legacy version designed for iOS and Android prior to the creation of osu!lazer.

### Beatmap

osu! has an active community of beatmap creators, who create and submit beatmaps to the game for other users to play. Beatmaps can be created using the in-game editor, which includes various tools to assist in the process, such as a waveform display of the song and a hit object timeline. Beatmaps are rated by other users based on their quality, and can be ranked, approved, qualified, or loved. Ranked beatmaps are included in the game's official rotation and contribute to players' performance points. Beatmaps can also include custom skins, which change the appearance of hit objects and other elements in the game.
